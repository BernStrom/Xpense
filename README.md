 <hr />

Xpense is an expense tracker app that separates personal costs from business costs.

At its core, the app interface is fairly basic and only contains a form for inputting the details on the spending (**name**, **type** - *Personal or Business*, **amount**) and a list of expenses separated into 2 sections (*Personal, Business*).

For adding new expenses, you can tap on the **+** button at the top right and a second screen would appear for you to key in your expense details. When done, simply tap the **Save** button at the top right and the new expense will appear on the main screen of the app in their assigned expense type section.

To delete any existing expenses, you can simply swipe left on the expense itself that you wish to remove and a **Delete** button would appear on the right side of the expense item. Either tap on the delete button or simply swipe all the way to the left to remove the item.

## Trying it yourself

Xpense is written using Xcode 13.2 and Swift 5.0. To try it out, you can clone this project and build it immediately by opening `Xpense.xcodeproj`.

As far as I know the app feature is complete, but there are likely to be errors all over the place at least to begin with â€“ if you hit any problems, either building or running the app, please let me know.

## Important notes on usage

Keep in mind that this app is simply a project designed and built for my own personal educational purposes only. The sole purpose for this app project was to gain practical experience in building an app in iOS with Swift & SwiftUI. The state of this app was never meant to be production-ready, published onto the App Store, or to be monetized in any way, shape, or form.

If you wish to do any of the above, you will have to make some changes to the app before submitting to the App Store for approval. Please keep in mind of any potential violation of third-party license, such as the usage of SF Symbols and/or Emoji of the app icon.
